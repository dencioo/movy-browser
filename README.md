# Movy Browser

Movy Browser is my personal React app for browsing movies. It’s a simple, interactive app where you can explore popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies right from your browser. I built it to practice React, component-based architecture, and working with external APIs.

## Features
- Browse popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies
- View movie details like overview, rating, and release date
- Clean and responsive UI
- Component-based React structure

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- React.js + Tailwind CSS
- The Movie Database API (TMDB API)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dencioo/movy-browser.git
2. Install Dependencies
   ```bash

3. Add your .env file with your TMDB API key:
   ```bash
   VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
