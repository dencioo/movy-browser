# Movy Browser

Movy Browser is my personal React app for browsing movies. Itâ€™s a simple, interactive app where you can explore popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies right from your browser. I built it to practice React, component-based architecture, and working with external APIs.

## Features
- Browse popular, top-rated, and upcoming movies
- View movie details like overview, rating, and release date
- Clean and responsive UI
- Component-based React structure

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- React.js + Tailwind CSS
- The Movie Database API (TMDB API)
